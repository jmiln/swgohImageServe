Just a little side app to make images for the ;mycharacter command from SWGOHBot

This grabs images from swgoh.gg the first time a request comes through, then uses the stored one after that

GearIcons/ is the base images that go around the character's images
imageOut/ is where all the ones that are created are stored.
partials/, css/, and ejs/ are where the it's all put together to make em look correct

In order to use this, you need to send a GET request to the IP that it's running on
(Ex: http://localhost:3600/char/DARTHREVAN/7/85/13/3/2/dark)
You can use an app like Postman to test this locally
